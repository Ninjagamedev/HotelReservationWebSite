# HotelReservationWebSite
Last project of my Profissional GPSI course concluded in 2020.  

Fully functional website with both user and admin interfaces that lets admins add new hotels and users make see and make reservations.  

This project was made using bootstrap, html, css, javascript for some animations and UI and php for backend.  

For the database we had to use MariaDB so there is also the sql script inside the "Base de Dados" folder.  

This project was tested and ran using xampp and phpmyadmin so its far from a safe project to host online.
